🚀 **Some Key Features of This Template** 🚀

✨ **Added More Paths** ✨
- Expanded the search paths for thorough coverage.

🧠 **Utilized Proper Regex** 🧠
- Many tools match `root/admin` which often results in false positives because root/admin is something that are commonly found in web responses. So it often gives false positives Instead, It's more specific and gives you fewer false positives.
    ```yaml
    regex:
        - "cp_postgres:.*:.*:.*:.*:.*:.*:.*:"
        - "postfix:.*:.*:.*:.*:.*:.*:.*:"
        - "pcap:.*:.*:.*:.*:.*:.*:.*:"
        - "nobody:.*:.*:.*:.*:.*:.*:.*:"
    ```

📉 **Avoiding Over-Reliance on Status Codes** 📉
- While many tools match the 200 (OK) status code to avoid false positives, this template does not rely solely on status codes. As we all know how servers can behave oddly sometimes, for that critical findings might be missed if responses like 400 or 500 are ignored. This template depends on proper regex matching.

💡 **Note** 💡
- In some cases, Nuclei may indicate the template is invalid. If you encounter this issue, simply [download the Nuclei tool](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei/releases/tag/v3.2.8) and run it using the following command:
  ```bash
  ./nuclei -l list-of-domains -t mass-hunt-CVE-2024-24919-with-many-paths.yaml
  ```
